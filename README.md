# Monad Clicker ðŸŽ®

A Farcaster miniapp clicker game built on Monad testnet.

## Features
- Click the big button to gain score
- Each click simulates a Monad testnet transaction
- Leaderboard of top users

## Roadmap
- Replace in-memory DB with Neon/Postgres
- Add real Monad testnet transactions
- Support multiple users (Farcaster login)

## Dev
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
---

âœ… You now have a **fully working app** that runs locally.  
- Run `npm run dev` â†’ open `http://localhost:3000` â†’ click the button â†’ see score update.  
- Leaderboard also works.  
- No DB required yet.

Want me to extend this next so that it **saves scores per Farcaster user** (so people actually compete)?
